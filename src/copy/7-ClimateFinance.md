## Climate finance

Pakistan updated its climate pledge in 2021, to set a “cumulative conditional target” of limiting emissions to 50% of what it expects its business-as-usual levels to be in 2030. It says that 15% of this will be met by its own resources and 35% is subject to receiving climate finance.

“Climate finance” refers to money – both from public and private sources – that is used to help reduce emissions and increase resilience against the negative impacts of climate change.

Under the Paris Agreement, developed countries – who are most responsible for climate change since it first started – have pledged to provide climate finance to developing nations.

In its 2021 international climate pledge, Pakistan says that meeting its emissions targets will require $101bn in climate finance by 2030 and an additional $65bn by 2040. This includes:

- $20bn for replacing under-construction coal projects with hydropower
- $50bn for achieving its target of producing 60% of its electricity from renewables including hydropower by 2030
- $20bn to upgrade the electricity transmission network by 2040
- $18bn for buying out and closing “relatively new coal projects”
- $13bn for replacing coal projects with solar

Pakistan’s pledge adds that it will require $7-14bn per year to adapt to the impacts of climate change.

It also says that “Pakistan has enjoyed very limited access to international climate finance” so far, noting it has received money for one project from the Adaptation Fund, three projects from the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and 19 projects from the Global Environment Fund.

Carbon Brief analysis shows that Pakistan received $2.2bn in climate finance in 2020, making it the world’s eighth largest recipient that year. The UK, Germany and Japan were the countries to give the most funds to Pakistan.

Pakistan’s climate pledge also specifically calls for funds for loss and damage from climate change. (Loss and damage is a term used for the suffering already caused by climate change, see Carbon Brief’s full explainer for more information.)

It says that Pakistan needs help dealing with glacial lake outburst floods, seawater intrusions, droughts, heatwaves, tropical storms, landslides and river flooding (see: Impacts and adaptation).

The pledge estimates that damages to infrastructure alone will account for around 70% of the $7-14bn in adaptation funding required per year.
