## Impacts and adaptation

Facing a wide range of climate disasters and with a large vulnerable population, Pakistan is often described as one of the countries most affected by climate change globally.

According to one 2021 climate risk index, Pakistan was the eighth most-affected country from 2000-19.

One of the greatest climate impacts facing Pakistan is flooding linked to extreme rainfall and the overflow of rivers, which tend to be close to human settlements and agricultural land. 

The country has faced deadly floods every year for the past 13 years, with 2010 and 2022 among the worst for number of people killed and area of land affected.

(The year 1950 was also particularly deadly for flooding in Pakistan, despite less land being affected than in 2010 and 2022. At this time, far fewer flood defences were in place than today, meaning a smaller flood could have a larger human impact.)

From June to August 2022, Pakistan received nearly 190% more rain than its 30-year average. This drove catastrophic flooding affecting 33 million people and killing more than 1,700.

A study published in the wake of the floods found that these record rains were made 75% more intense by human-caused climate change. (As temperature rises, the air can hold more moisture, which can lead to heavier rainfall.)

Other factors that made the floods so deadly were the proximity of human settlements to flood plains, an outdated river management system and ongoing political and economic instability, the study said.

In February 2023, the Guardian reported that thousands of families remain homeless and without livelihoods months after the floods.

The 2023 floods also caused an estimated $30bn in financial losses.

In January 2023, Pakistan and the UN held a joint summit in Geneva to raise funds to help rebuild the country in the wake of the floods. At the event, over $8bn was pledged by other governments, multilateral banks and private donors, Climate Home News reported.

Climate Home News also reported that the World Bank was accused of “sleeping through” the floods by failing to spend pledged finance on new flood defences for Karachi ahead of the disaster.

Additionally, Climate Home News reported that cuts to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) Pakistan branch left them unable to respond adequately to the 2023 disaster. The publication reported:

“In 2016, OCHA had around 35 staff in Pakistan and a budget of more than $5m. By 2021, its budget was $1.1m and in 2022 it employed seven people.”

Pakistan’s Tribune in February 2023 reported that several large international companies, including Alphabet and Meta, had pledged funds in response to the flooding despite spending a decade evading paying taxes on their operations within the country.

High-intensity rainfall in Pakistan is expected to “significantly increase further” if global temperatures reach 2C above pre-industrial levels. 

As well as experiencing river and flash flooding, the country’s many mountains and glaciers make it prone to deadly glacial lake outburst floods.

Pakistan contains more glacier ice than anywhere else in the world outside of the polar regions.

Glaciers – which are essentially frozen rivers – are fast disappearing because of climate change. Research found that two-thirds of glacier ice in the High Mountain Asia region, which covers part of Pakistan along with neighbouring countries, could vanish by the end of the century under a scenario of very high emissions.

As glaciers melt away, they can leave behind large pools of meltwater in the grooves of where the ice once was. These are known as glacial lakes. If the water rises too high or surrounding land or ice gives way, the lake can burst, unleashing a tsunami-like wave that can be deadly for people living nearby.

A study published in February 2023 found that Pakistan has one of the highest populations exposed to glacial lake outburst floods in the world. In the High Mountain Asia region, every person lives within roughly six miles of a glacial lake, according to the study.

In 2022 alone, there were at least 16 glacial lake outburst incidents in Pakistan’s northern Gilgit-Baltistan region, CNN reported. Communities living in the region have been forced to migrate seasonally or permanently because of the outbursts, according to Pakistan’s Centre for Strategic and Contemporary Research.

As well as causing floods, the melting of Pakistan’s vast glaciers is threatening the water supply of hundreds of millions of people. The disappearance of Pakistan’s glaciers also threatens the culture and unique way of life of Indigenous people living in the country’s mountainous regions.

Pakistan is also highly at risk from heatwaves – and has experienced some of the highest temperatures recorded anywhere on Earth.

The highest temperature recorded in Pakistan is 53.7C. This occurred during a 2017 summer heatwave where above-50C heat was recorded for four consecutive days in the city of Turbat, Balochistan. Such temperatures are above the limits of what humans can tolerate, without seeking shelter.

In 2022, Pakistan experienced an unusually early heatwave, recording temperatures of 49C in April. This heat, which killed 90 people across Pakistan and India, was made 30 times more likely by human-caused climate change, according to a rapid analysis.

Just 13% of people in Pakistan’s cities have access to air conditioning, according to Asia News Network. The figure is just 2% in rural areas. 

Global temperature rise of 2C will cause heatwaves similar to what occurred in Pakistan in 2022 to become a further 2-20 times more likely.

Pakistan is also significantly affected by drought. While record rains have occurred in some parts of the country, “some dry areas have become drier as they have experienced less than normal precipitation”, Pakistan says in its 2021 international climate pledge.

In 2019, Pakistan’s largest provinces of Balochistan and Sindh were gripped by a major drought affecting more than 500,000 people. Reporting on the disaster at the time, the International Federation of Red Cross said “animals are dying and people are struggling to feed themselves”. 

The country is also at risk from tropical storms. In 1970, Pakistan experienced the deadliest storm in history when Cyclone Bhola killed 500,000 people. More recently, Pakistan experienced heavy rainfall from Tropical Cyclone Gulab in 2021.

Pakistan has the third-highest levels of air pollution in the world after China and India. Each year, 128,000 people die prematurely due to toxic smog, mainly driven by fossil fuel use for power, industry and transport.

In 2021, Pakistan announced it was developing its first National Adaptation Plan in order to prepare for the impacts of climate change. It is due to be published this year.
