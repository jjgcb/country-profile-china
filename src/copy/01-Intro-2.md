More than 1,700 people died in Pakistan’s 2022 floods, which were fuelled by rains made [75% more intense](https://www.carbonbrief.org/climate-change-likely-increased-extreme-rainfall-that-led-to-pakistan-flooding/) by climate change. Many displaced by the floods [remain homeless](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/feb/08/pakistan-families-hungry-and-homeless-floods) in 2023.

The devastating impact of the floods buoyed Pakistan’s call for a [loss-and-damage](https://interactive.carbonbrief.org/q-a-should-developed-nations-pay-for-loss-and-damage-from-climate-change/) fund to be established at the [COP27](https://www.carbonbrief.org/cop27-key-outcomes-agreed-at-the-un-climate-talks-in-sharm-el-sheikh/) climate summit in 2022.

Pakistan has set itself a “cumulative conditional target” of limiting emissions to 50% of what it expects its business-as-usual levels to be in 2030. It says that 15% will be met by its own resources and 35% is subject to international financial support.
