## Politics

Pakistan was established in 1947 following the end of [200 years](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/8/14/how-india-pakistan-and-bangladesh-were-formed) of British colonial rule over the Indian subcontinent. At this time, the UK divided the subcontinent into Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan.

It is now the world’s [fifth-most populous country](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/07/21/global-population-projected-to-exceed-8-billion-in-2022-half-live-in-just-seven-countries/) and the second-largest Muslim population after [Indonesia](https://www.carbonbrief.org/the-carbon-brief-profile-indonesia/). It is also the second-largest country in South Asia by area.

Pakistan is [ethnically and linguistically](https://www.fao.org/pakistan/our-office/pakistan-at-a-glance/en/) diverse. The national language of Pakistan is Urdu, which is also the official language along with English. Other languages spoken in Pakistan include Punjabi, Saraiki, Pashto, Sindhi, Balochi, Brahvi, Hindko, Kashmiri, Shina, Balti and further local languages.

Pakistan is currently facing a severe economic crisis. An editorial focused on the crisis in the [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/9ea7f155-3c4e-48f0-8125-3f64faacf0eb) said that the country’s foreign exchange reserves dropped to just $3.7bn in late January 2023, equivalent to just three weeks of imports. The FT added:

>“As it is, Pakistan risks following Sri Lanka into default, where food and medicine have been in short supply. But with a population 10 times that of Sri Lanka, a nuclear arsenal, a military with a history of meddling, and extremist Islamists who are displaying their bloodthirsty fanaticism once more, default is a situation international creditors and multilateral institutions must help Pakistan avoid.”

The Indian newspaper [Mint](https://www.livemint.com/news/world/pakistans-economic-crisis-gets-worse-external-debt-surges-by-38-11678248570775.html) reported that the country’s external debt rose by a sharp 38% to $73bn by the end of January, when compared to the year before. [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/3/8/how-skyrocketing-inflation-has-hit-pakistan-most-vulnerable) reported that inflation in the country surged to 31.5% in February, the highest level since 1974.

<p>As of 2018, <a href="https://databankfiles.worldbank.org/public/ddpext_download/poverty/987B9C90-CB9F-4D93-AE8C-750588BF00QA/current/Global_POVEQ_PAK.pdf">40%</a> of Pakistan’s population lived in poverty. The current figure is likely to be higher following the <a href="https://www.ifpri.org/publication/covid-19-estimating-impact-economy-and-poverty-pakistan-using-sam-multiplier-model">onset of the Covid pandemic</a> and a cost-of-living crisis fuelled by sky-high energy prices and inflation.</p><br>

<p>Energy is right at the heart of Pakistan’s ongoing economic crisis.</p><br>

Pakistan’s power sector is plagued by a large [circular debt](https://tribune.com.pk/story/2366463/whopping-circular-debt-why-and-how), a type of public debt that has built up due to the cascading impact of unpaid government subsidies on power distributors and producers, as well as [deep structural issues](https://file.pide.org.pk/pdfpideresearch/wp-0191-circular-debt-an-unfortunate-misnomer.pdf?_gl=1*pzqyai*_ga*MTA5MjcyNDg5Ni4xNjgxMjI2OTkx*_ga_Q4CE3R25GL*MTY4MTIyNjk5MS4xLjAuMTY4MTIyNjk5MS4wLjAuMA..*_ga_T5TLWHEVW9*MTY4MTIyNjk5MS4xLjAuMTY4MTIyNjk5MS4wLjAuMA..&_ga=2.72946067.18738684.1681226991-1092724896.1681226991) in the sector.

The country is heavily reliant on importing fossil fuels, which currently make up 40% of Pakistan’s primary energy supply.

Pakistan also suffers from chronic energy access issues, with [one in four](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.ELC.ACCS.ZS?locations=PK) people lacking access to electricity in 2020.

All of these factors left Pakistan [highly vulnerable](https://tribune.com.pk/article/81864/22-loans-in-61-years-pakistans-unwavering-habit-of-going-to-the-imf) to the global energy price hike spurred by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. 

In June 2022, Pakistan’s petroleum minister told journalists that the country was struggling to secure supplies of liquefied natural gas (LNG) as it was being outbid by European countries looking to source fuels away from Russia.

According to Pakistan’s [Dawn](https://www.dawn.com/news/1696772) newspaper, minister Musadik Malik said:

>“We don’t have enough energy right now. The gas is not available and we can’t afford such expensive gas. So what we are doing is arranging alternates. The recent increase in production, imports of coal and furnace oil is part of the same strategy.”

In January 2023, the country faced a [complete power breakdown](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/1/23/pakistan-hit-by-nationwide-power-outage-after-grid) due to a technical fault while undertaking energy-saving measures, which lasted for 24 hours in some areas.

In February, energy minister Khurram Dastgir Khan said lack of access to LNG was forcing the country to return to coal and promised to “quadruple” domestically fuelled coal power capacity in response to the crisis, according to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/pakistan-plans-quadruple-domestic-coal-fired-power-move-away-gas-2023-02-13/). (See [coal, oil and gas for more information](#oil-gas-and-coal).)

The government is currently in talks with the [International Monetary Fund](https://www.imf.org/en/Home) (IMF) to secure a $6.5bn loan in order to avoid a default. It has already taken “tough measures” in a bid to secure the loan, including increasing energy prices and taxes amid its cost-of-living crisis, [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-20/imf-sees-substantial-progress-by-pakistan-toward-loan-program?sref=Oz9Q3OZU) reported.

(Pakistan has received 22 loans from the IMF in the past 60 years, according to the [Pakistan Tribune](https://tribune.com.pk/article/81864/22-loans-in-61-years-pakistans-unwavering-habit-of-going-to-the-imf).)

The energy and economic crisis is heightened still further by political instability. 

Former cricket star Imran Khan swept to power in 2018 with the populist party he founded, the [Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf](https://insaf.pk/what-is-pti) (PTI) party. But he was ousted in April 2022 after becoming the first prime minister to [lose a no-confidence vote](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/4/9/pakistan-prime-minister-imran-khan-no-confidence-vote) in parliament. His removal led to [widespread protests](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/4/11/imran-khan-removal-as-pm-triggers-protests-across-pakistan).

Shehbaz Sharif of the centre-right [Pakistan Muslim League (N)](https://pmln.org/) party was [elected](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/4/11/shehbaz-sharif-elected-as-pakistans-new-prime-minister-2) as the replacement a few days later, causing tension with Khan’s remaining supporters in parliament. Sharif’s party is a member of the [Pakistan Democratic Movement](https://tribune.com.pk/story/2275180/politics-of-alliances-and-pdm), an alliance of [more than a dozen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Democratic_Movement#Parties) political parties that opposed Khan’s leadership.

In May 2023, Khan was [arrested](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/former-pakistan-pm-imran-khan-arrested-geo-tv-2023-05-09/) by Pakistan’s anti-corruption bureau, leading to deadly violence nationwide. His arrest was ruled [illegal](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/11/pakistan-army-deployed-across-country-as-unrest-triggered-by-imran-khan-arrest-continues) by Pakistan’s Supreme Court a few days later.

Later this year, Pakistan will hold general elections. They are due to take place no later than [60 days](https://pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/part8.ch2.html) after the dissolution of the National Assembly in August, meaning they should take place before the end of October.

A poll of 2,000 people conducted by [Gallup Pakistan](https://www.gallup.com.pk/post/34223) in March 2023 found widespread support for Khan, with his approval rating jumping to 61% in February, up from 36% in January last year. Sharif’s popularity stood at 32% in February, dropping from 51% last year.

Both [Khan](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/rich-states-havent-done-enough-environment-pakistan-pm-says-2021-06-04/) and [Sharif](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/06/pakistan-floodwaters-climate-disasters-international-aid) have spoken passionately about the impact of climate change on Pakistan – and the need for [historic large emitters](https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-which-countries-are-historically-responsible-for-climate-change/) such as the US and UK to pay for their pollution.

While in power, Khan set out a number of policies on transitioning to renewable power and using “nature-based solutions” to tackle climate change (discussed in more detail below). 

In 2015, a [decision](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pakistan-climatechange-idUKKBN0KU0XL20150121) was made to reinstate Pakistan’s climate change division as a ministry. Current climate minister [Sherry Rehman](https://sherryrehman.com/) has been a vocal force for climate justice at UN talks. (See: Paris pledge.)
