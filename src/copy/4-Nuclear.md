## Nuclear

Pakistan currently has six operating nuclear power plants. The total installed capacity is 3,530 megawatts (MW).

Five of these plants make use of Chinese technology and were financed by China. This includes three nuclear reactors in Pakistan’s Punjab province and two in Karachi.

The second of the Karachi reactors – a 1,100MW plant – connected to the grid in February 2023.

According to the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, the two Karachi plants are part of the China-Pakistan economic corridor, a 3,000km infrastructure network project in Pakistan that is a major plank in China’s wider Belt and Road Initiative.

Nuclear power provided around 9% of Pakistan’s electricity in 2020, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). This rose to around 14% in 2022 with the opening of new plants, according to the thinktank Ember.

Back in 2017, Pakistan’s atomic energy commission chairman told Reuters that the country had plans to build a further two to three big reactors with the aim of achieving 8,800MW of nuclear power by 2030.

However, no further new reactors have been announced. Neither the country’s international climate pledge published in 2021 nor its Alternative and Renewable Energy Policy published in 2019 mention nuclear power.

Pakistan’s Dawn reported that, in February 2023, Rafael Grossi, head of the Interna­tional Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said that there was “strong political support for new nuclear power plants in Pakistan” during a visit to Islamabad.
