Pakistan is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change in the world. It is currently in the midst of a crippling energy and economic crisis that has brought it to the brink of bankruptcy.

The country, which is the [fifth](https://gulfnews.com/world/asia/pakistan/pakistan-surpasses-brazil-to-become-worlds-5th-most-populous-country-1.72557051) most populous in the world and home to more than 230 million people, was the 18th largest emitter of greenhouse gases in 2018.

Its current crisis is closely tied to its dependency on fossil-fuel imports, particularly in light of global price hikes driven by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Imported fuels currently make up [40%](https://tribune.com.pk/story/2394481/pakistan-a-major-fossil-fuel-importer) of the country’s primary energy supply.
