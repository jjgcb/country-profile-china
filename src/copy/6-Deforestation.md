## Deforestation, wood burning and agriculture

A quarter of people in Pakistan lack access to electricity. Instead, many rely on the burning of wood, “biogas” – a gas produced from animal and plant waste – and other types of waste in order to generate energy in the home.

This is particularly true for food preparation, a task mostly undertaken by women. Only [half](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.CFT.ACCS.ZS?locations=PK) of Pakistan’s population have access to “clean cooking” and the rest rely on polluting and inefficient cookstoves.

According to the South Asian news agency [ANI](https://www.aninews.in/news/world/asia/rapid-deforestation-puts-pakistans-climate-policies-in-jeopardy20210609182354/), 68% of people in Pakistan rely on firewood. This is one of the major drivers of deforestation in the country, alongside urbanisation and food and commodity production. ([Illegal logging](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2010-oct-13-la-fg-pakistan-logging-20101013-story.html) by the Taliban has also contributed.)

When Pakistan was first established, a third of its land – more than 260,000 square km – was covered by forest. But, by 2010, forest cover fell to just 5% (around 40,000 square km), according to ANI.

Forest loss has slowed since 2010, but has not stopped completely. In 2021, Pakistan lost 0.63 square km of tree cover, causing the equivalent of 23,500 tonnes of CO2e to be released into the atmosphere, according to the [Global Forest Watch](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/dashboards/country/PAK/?category=summary&dashboardPrompts=eyJzaG93UHJvbXB0cyI6dHJ1ZSwicHJvbXB0c1ZpZXdlZCI6W10sInNldHRpbmdzIjp7Im9wZW4iOmZhbHNlLCJzdGVwSW5kZXgiOjAsInN0ZXBzS2V5IjoiIn0sIm9wZW4iOnRydWUsInN0ZXBzS2V5IjoiZG93bmxvYWREYXNoYm9hcmRTdGF0cyJ9&location=WyJjb3VudHJ5IiwiUEFLIl0%3D&map=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%3D%3D&showMap=true).

Deforestation has impacted Pakistan’s unique biodiversity.

The country is [home](https://www.cbd.int/countries/profile/?country=pk#:~:text=Pakistan%20has%20195%20mammal%20species,(over%20400%20being%20endemic)) to: 195 mammal species, six of which are “endemic” (only found in Pakistan); 668 birds, 25 of which are endemic; 177 reptiles, 13 of which are endemic; 22 amphibians, nine of which are endemic; 198 freshwater fishes, 29 of which are endemic, 5,000 invertebrates; and 5,700 flowering plants, of which 400 are endemic.

But, according to the UN’s [Convention on Biological Diversity](https://www.cbd.int/countries/profile/?country=pk#:~:text=Pakistan%20has%20195%20mammal%20species,(over%20400%20being%20endemic)), nature in Pakistan faces an “impending national disaster” because of human activities and degradation of habitats.

It notes that the mangrove forests of the Indus Delta, the largest of their kind in the world, declined by half from the 1970s to the mid-1990s.

Deforestation has also exacerbated the impacts of climate change, including [flood risk](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade9336). This is because the presence of dense forest can act as a natural flood barrier and prevent river bank erosion. 

Agriculture accounts for 19% of Pakistan’s GDP and 60% of its exports, according to the [Economic Survey of Pakistan 2020-21](https://www.finance.gov.pk/survey_2021.html). It also provides a livelihood to 68% of Pakistan’s rural population and employs 45% of the national labour force.

Some [230,000](https://www.fao.org/pakistan/our-office/pakistan-at-a-glance/en/) square km out of Pakistan’s total area of 800,000 square km are used for crop production. 

The country has the world’s largest continuous irrigation system covering almost 80% of its cultivated area, according to the UN’s [Food and Agriculture Organization](https://www.fao.org/pakistan/our-office/pakistan-at-a-glance/en/) (FAO).

The agricultural sector is also the largest consumer of freshwater, accounting for 95% of total withdrawals, according to Pakistan’s 2021 [international climate pledge](https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/NDC/2022-06/Pakistan%20Updated%20NDC%202021.pdf).

Pakistan is among the world’s top 10 producers of wheat, cotton, sugarcane, mangoes, dates and kinnow oranges – and ranked 10th for rice production, according to the FAO.

In addition, Pakistan’s livestock sector contributes 11% to the country’s GDP and employs around 35m people, the FAO says.

Both crop and livestock production in the country face steep risks from climate change. (See: [Impacts and adaptation](#impacts-and-adaptation).) In its international climate pledge, Pakistan says one of the economic sectors most at risk from climate change is the “agriculture-food-water nexus”.

Agriculture, forestry and land use accounts for around [18%](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenvs.2022.1014660/full#:~:text=Agriculture%2C%20forestry%20and%20land%20use,greenhouse%20gas%20emissions%20in%20Pakistan.) of Pakistan’s total greenhouse gas emissions.

In its international climate pledge, Pakistan says it will tackle agricultural emissions through a “complete ban” on the open burning of rice stubble, solid waste and other hazardous materials. 

[Many farmers](https://www.theigc.org/blogs/stubble-burning-pakistan-why-it-continues-and-how-can-it-be-curtailed#:~:text=Between%20October%20and%20January%20every,fields%20for%20subsequent%20planting%20seasons.) in Pakistan burn the remnants of rice crops between October and January to clear the land for sowing wheat. Burning rice stubble is considered the cheapest and quickest way, but drives CO2 emissions and deadly air pollution. An [FAO study](https://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/ca6989en/) found 20% of Pakistan’s thick air pollution comes from crop burning.

The climate pledge does not mention new efforts to stop deforestation or reduce emissions from livestock rearing.
