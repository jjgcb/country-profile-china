## Oil, gas and coal

Fossil fuels have long dominated Pakistan’s energy supplies. In 2021, gas (42%), oil (27%) and coal (17%) accounted for a combined 86% of the country’s energy needs, with renewables (10%, mainly hydro) and nuclear (4%) making up the rest (see graphic and sections below).

There is a long history of fossil fuel extraction in Pakistan.

Exploration for oil in Pakistan began in the late 19th century, fuelled by a need to power a railway system being built to secure the Indo-Afghan border. 

The country’s first gas field was discovered in Balochistan in 1952, near the Sui gas field, which remains the country’s biggest gas discovery to date.

Along with oil and gas, coal was also discovered in Balochistan in the late 19th century and mined to serve colonial railways under the British regime. 

Today, domestic oil production accounts for just 16% of demand. Likewise, while domestic gas production has grown 10-fold since 1970 it has nevertheless failed to keep up with demand.

As a result, gas imports have been growing rapidly and have doubled since the first liquified natural gas (LNG) terminal was built in 2015. 

The country’s dependency on imported fossil fuels is a well recognised problem that has constrained growth and kept energy and electricity prices steep.

Pakistan’s coal deposits are concentrated in the provinces of Sindh, Punjab and Balochistan, with total reserves estimated at 185bn tonnes. Sindh is host to two major coalfields: the Lakhra coalfield and the Thar coalfield in the Thar desert bordering India, the latter containing one of the world’s largest lignite deposits. Lignite is the most polluting form of coal. 

Coal production in Pakistan is currently plagued by social, environmental and safety issues, as working conditions have not improved in decades. According to the Pakistan Central Mines Labour Federation (PCLMF), the country’s coal sector employs 100,000 workers in 400 coal mines, miners “usually start[ing] work at age 13” and “forced into unemployment” due to illnesses and injuries by the age of 30. 

Child labour, bonded labour, deaths, explosions, modern slavery conditions and child sexual abuse are “rife” in Balochistan’s mines, where coal mining began in Pakistan, the Guardian reported in 2020. PCLMF estimates that between 100 and 200 labourers die on average in mine accidents every year, with 18 killed in May 2022 alone.

The coal rush in Thar, whose 175bn tonne coal reserves “exceed[s] the oil reserves of both Saudi Arabia and Iran”, is also taking a toll on Indigenous communities and desert ecosystems, Dawn reported earlier this year.

Civil society groups have pointed to land acquisition without consent for Thar’s expanding coal mines and torture of mine workers, Dawn reported, while environmental groups have warned of mining’s groundwater impacts in the desert region.

As a result of its limited low-carbon energy supplies and a failure to further expand domestic coal, oil and gas production, Pakistan remains heavily dependent on imported fossil fuels. The expense of sourcing these imports is one reason for the country’s chronic energy deficit.

In 2021, shortages in Europe coupled with high demand in Asia pushed spot LNG prices to record highs, forcing Pakistan to pay the most it ever has for shipments. The country has only two long-term LNG contracts with Qatar.

The next year, long-term gas suppliers cancelled their shipments coinciding with the surge in European gas prices brought on by Russia’s war in Ukraine.

Pakistan issued another tender for long-term LNG supply starting in 2023. However, not a single bidder responded, leaving little spare supply until 2026, Bloomberg reported. 

Furthermore, many of Pakistan’s transnational pipeline projects have been delayed: the country may face arbitration and an $18bn fine if it fails to finish work on the Iran-Pakistan (IP) gas pipeline.

Pakistan’s end-of-year energy plans in 2022 indicated that the country wants to bring down the share of imported coal and LNG to 8% and 2% by 2030, respectively, to serve energy security needs, support climate targets, avoid the high cost of imported fuels and supply challenges driven by the international market.

The cash-strapped country is also set to receive its first shipment of discounted Russian crude oil in Karachi in May, with Islamabad to target imports of 100,000 barrels per day “if the first transaction goes through smoothly”, Reuters reported.

The tension between securing adequate and affordable energy supplies to expand access, at the same time as meeting the country’s climate goals, has caused several shifts in Pakistan’s strategy.

Former prime minister Nawaz Sharif’s answer to rising energy bills and chronic powercuts was to boost domestic coal production and approve new coal power plants. Later, then-prime minister Imran Khan announced a moratorium on new coal power at the Climate Ambition Summit in 2020, convened to mark the fifth anniversary of the Paris agreement.

The Third Pole reported that this would not affect projects in the pipeline under the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), instead only affecting two imported coal projects which “had already been scrapped because of an earlier moratorium on using imported coal”.

Soon after the country’s worst nation-wide blackout in January 2023, brought on by energy-saving measures gone wrong and old transmission equipment, the government of recently installed prime minister Shehbaz Sharif announced another shift, as inflation hit double-digit figures.

This includes a plan to cut imports and revive domestic energy production, in particular coal from the Thar coal fields, a decision sparking climate fears among some, but one that other energy commentators say is essential to ensure energy security first while Pakistan pivots to a “sustainable growth trajectory”.

In February 2023, Reuters reported that the country’s energy minister wanted to “quadruple domestic coal-fired capacity…and will not build new gas-fired plants”, which experts clarified to Carbon Brief would involve imported coal plants with spare capacity running on domestic coal.

In March 2023, Sharif formally inaugurated the new 1,320 megawatt Thar Coal Block-I Coal Electricity Integration project under CPEC, which would need 7.8m tonnes of domestically-mined coal a year, Global Times reported.

Through these twists and turns, Pakistan has been shifting its electricity supplies away from expensive, imported oil towards coal and gas, as the chart below shows.

(Nuclear and, more recently, wind and solar, have also been expanding, see below.)

However, Pakistan’s increasing reliance on imported gas to generate electricity has been called into question during the global energy crisis, when prices surged to record highs.

According to thinktank Global Energy Monitor, Pakistan currently has 7.6 gigwatts (GW) of coal capacity – almost all of which has been built since 2015 – with another 4GW in its pipeline.

Pakistan has announced plans to revive long-stalled coal plants along the CPEC, raising “fresh questions” about China’s pledge to not build any new coal plants abroad, China Dialogue reported.

The country’s former chief economist Dr Pervez Tahir pointed out in the Express Tribune that “coal is all that Pakistan has to reduce dependence on an increasingly uncertain world” but that it must “use modern technologies of mitigation”.

(Pakistan currently has extremely limited wind and solar capacity, see: Renewables including hydropower.)
