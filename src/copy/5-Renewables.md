## Renewables including hydropower

Hydropower is currently the largest source of low-carbon power in Pakistan, accounting for 26% of the country’s electricity supply, according to IEA data.

Pakistan’s considerable water resources are tied to the Indus, one of the world’s largest rivers, which originates in Tibet and flows through the Himalayas before cutting across Pakistan and emptying into the Arabian sea near Karachi.

According to Pakistan’s Water and Power Development Authority, there is 60,000MW of hydropower potential in the country, of which 7,320 MW has been developed.

China has financed several large hydropower projects in Pakistan as part of its China-Pakistan economic corridor, one faction of China’s wider Belt and Road Initiative.

This includes the operational Karot project (720MW) and two plants that are still under construction, Suki Kinari (870MW) and Kohala (1,124MW).

In January 2023, France announced it will loan Pakistan $130m to build the Keyal Khuwar hydropower project (128MW), according to Pakistan’s the News International.

In April, Saudi Arabia pledged to loan Pakistan $240m for another major hydropower project, the Mohmand Multipurpose Dam Project (800MW), according to Utilities Middle East.

The construction of major dams has previously sparked protests in Pakistan.

In 2020, hundreds of people in Pakistan-administered Kashmir protested over the Chinese-funded Neelum-Jhelum Hydroelectric Project, which diverted one of the two rivers flowing through the city, according to Voice of America.

The diversion of the river had many impacts on the city, including causing a rise in local temperatures and disruption to rainfall patterns, according to the residents. A local doctor noted that cases of hepatitis, malaria and typhoid increased after the river’s diversion.

In 2022, the plant developed a technical fault – and was “abandoned” entirely by its Chinese operators, according to India’s Economic Times.

Hydropower production in Pakistan faces threats from conflicts with neighbours that share its water resources and climate change (see: Impacts and adaptation).

There is currently a small number of wind and solar farms in Pakistan. They accounted for 3% of electricity generation in 2020, according to IEA data.

In its latest international climate pledge released in 2021, Pakistan says that 60% of its electricity will be generated from renewables including hydropower by 2030. This can be compared with the 29% these sources contributed in 2020.

Pakistan breaks down its renewable expansion plans further in its latest 10-year plan for power production released in 2023. It says that, by 2031 39% of its power will come from hydro, 10% from wind and 10% from solar. (The document notes that one of the “major determinants” of its plan for expanding renewable power is the vulnerability caused by Pakistan’s current heavy reliance on imported fossil fuels.)

Pakistan’s previous 10-year plan released the year before targeted a higher 65% of power from renewables and hydropower by 2030.

Explaining the decision to pursue a large expansion in hydropower alongside other renewables, Pakistan’s international climate pledge says:

>“Hydropower development in Pakistan is critical for the energy transition as it can even out the volatility of high shares of solar and wind.”

It comes after the country released an Alternative and Renewable Energy policy in 2019, which said that Pakistan “intends” to have 20% of its total electricity generation capacity from wind and solar by 2025 and 30% by 2030.

According to the World Bank, this will require Pakistan to install around 24,000MW of solar and wind by 2030, up from 1,500MW today. This represents 150-200MW a month from now until 2030, it notes.

The World Bank’s analysis also says that this would represent a “least-cost” electricity expansion scenario, resulting in fuel savings equal to $5bn over 20 years. (And this calculation was made before the global fuel price hike fuelled by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.)

It adds that using just 0.07% of Pakistan’s land for solar could generate enough power to meet its current electricity demand.

(The World Bank says its analysis informed Pakistan’s targets.)

As well as saving on fuel costs, a fast expansion of renewables could help Pakistan address its mounting circular debt in the power sector (see: Politics), an expert told Pakistan’s Tribune.

In August 2022, the government announced plans to add 9,000MW of solar to the grid as part of a “solar energy initiatives” scheme, in a bid to reduce its reliance on costly fossil fuel imports, the Tribune reported. As part of the scheme, the government plans to offer tax exemptions and waive import duties, the paper added.

In December 2022, prime minister Shehbaz Sharif urged Turkey to invest in new solar in Pakistan, saying that the country “cannot afford the import of such costly oil and petroleum products”, according to a separate report in the Tribune.

More widely, Pakistan estimated in its 2021 international climate pledge that the transition from fossil fuels to renewable including hydropower will require $101bn in foreign investment by 2030 (see: Climate finance). 

This includes $50bn for meeting its pledge of generating 60% of its electricity from renewables including hydro by 2030.
