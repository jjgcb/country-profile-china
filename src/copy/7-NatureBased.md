## ‘Nature-based solutions’

The idea of “[nature-based solutions](https://www.carbonbrief.org/qa-can-nature-based-solutions-help-address-climate-change/)” to climate change is a big hit with politicians in Pakistan, with several promising to restore the country’s degraded ecosystems in order to tackle emissions and biodiversity loss.

Current prime minister Shehbaz Sharif [said](https://www.brecorder.com/news/40207697) that nature-based solutions were at the heart of Pakistan’s climate strategy at the COP27 summit in 2022.

And former prime minister Imran Khan made [international headlines](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/interactive/2021/pakistan-tree-billion-tsunami-photos/) in 2018 with his “[Ten Billion Trees Tsunami](https://mocc.gov.pk/ProjectDetail/M2QzOWJmMjUtZTU3MC00NmFkLWE4YmMtZDFhMmRlOGU2NGRh#:~:text=The%20%22Ten%20Billion%20Tree%20Tsunami,territorial%20Forest%20and%20Wildlife%20departments)”, a national initiative to plant enough trees to cover 26.6% of Pakistan’s land area by 2030.

According to Pakistan’s 2021 international climate pledge, the plan was for 3.3bn plants to be planted or “regenerated” across Pakistan by 2023. Then, “phase two” would see 750-800m new plants a year for six years up to 2030.

[Deutsche Welle](https://www.dw.com/en/pakistan-environmentalists-slam-10-billion-trees-project/a-59062200) reported in 2021 that researchers and officials had raised concerns with the project. For example, the scheme had seen saplings planted in desert areas, requiring costly irrigation in order to survive, one researcher noted. A senior government official speaking on the condition of anonymity told DW that many planted saplings had died in intense heat.

The government had planted 1.5bn trees by March 2022, but the whole programme was then thrown into question when Khan was ousted from parliament in April that year, [Climate Home News](https://www.climatechangenews.com/2022/04/19/pakistans-tree-planting-ambition-in-doubt-after-imran-khans-exit/) reported.

In September, Pakistan’s the [Nation](https://www.nation.com.pk/14-Sep-2022/billion-tree-allegations) reported an official audit of the programme uncovered alleged evidence of overspending and fraud.

Following this, the [Tribune](https://tribune.com.pk/story/2379434/budget-cuts-for-plantation-drives-put-question-mark-on-priorities) reported in October that Sharif’s government had renamed the project “Green Pakistan” and slashed its annual budget from $49m to $33m.

Pakistan’s 2021 climate pledge references several other large-scale nature-based projects.

This includes the [Protected Areas Initiative](https://www.iucn.org/news/pakistan/202007/pakistans-protected-areas-initiative), which aims to get 15% of Pakistan’s land under protection by 2023. To achieve the aim, the government planned to create 15 new national parks covering 7,300 square kilometres, according to Pakistan’s climate pledge. It is not clear whether this will be achieved.

It also includes an [Ecosystem Restoration Initiative](https://www.sdpi.org/sdconference/Panel-write-ups/Shafqat%20Munir_Awais%20Umar-Ecosystem%20Restoration%202030-REV-12%20Oct%202021_WFP.pdf), which aims to restore 30% of Pakistan’s degraded forests, 5% of degraded cropland, 6% of degraded grassland and 10% of degraded wetland by 2030.

In September 2022, climate minister Sherry Rehman [announced](https://www.dawn.com/news/1712583) the [Living Indus Project](https://www.livingindus.com/), describing it as Pakistan’s “biggest climate initiative” that has the aim of protecting and restoring the Indus river, while boosting flood resilience in its vicinity. The project was [officially launched](https://un-dco.org/coordination-results/Climate-change-solutions-Pakistan) at COP27.

Reporting on the initiative, the [Third Pole](https://www.thethirdpole.net/en/climate/experts-welcome-futuristic-initiative-to-restore-indus-river-in-pakistan/) noted that several expert groups in Pakistan welcomed the plans. However, some raised concerns the initiative does not discuss the major impact of large hydropower projects on the Indus basin. (See: [Renewables including hydropower](#renewables-including-hydropower).)

(It is worth noting that the term “nature-based solutions” is viewed with deep scepticism by some groups. [Some argue](https://www.foei.org/bogus-nature-based-solutions-wont-solve-the-climate-crisis/) that the term can too easily be misused as a cover for greenwashing, while [others say](https://www.carbonbrief.org/cop26-key-outcomes-for-food-forests-land-use-and-nature-in-glasgow/) it minimises the intrinsic value of nature and/or the role that Indigenous people play in [safeguarding](https://www.vox.com/22518592/indigenous-people-conserve-nature-icca) Earth’s last remaining intact ecosystems.)
