## Paris pledge

Pakistan is part of three negotiating blocs at international climate talks, including the G77 plus China, the Like-Minded Developing Countries (LMDCs) and the Coalition for Rainforest Nations (CfRN). (More information on each group is available in an in-depth explainer of negotiating blocs by Carbon Brief.)

At COP27 in Egypt in 2022, Pakistan chaired the G77 plus China negotiating group – representing more than 130 nations – and was instrumental in the agreement of a specific fund for loss and damage. (Loss and damage is a term used for the suffering already caused by climate change, see Carbon Brief’s full explainer for more information.)

Pakistan’s position as chair came just months after floods, fuelled by rains made 75% more intense by climate change, devastated the country. In her closing remarks to the conference, Pakistan’s climate minister Sherry Rehman said the fund represented a “down payment in our joined futures and investment in our coming generations”.

Pakistan is signed up to the Paris Agreement, the international deal aimed at tackling climate change. It ratified the agreement in 2016.

The country’s greenhouse gas emissions were 428.6m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) in 2018 – making it the world’s 18th largest emitter, according to the CAIT database maintained by the World Resources Institute (WRI). This includes emissions from land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF). 

That year, its emissions per person (“per capita emissions”) were just two tonnes of CO2e, much lower than the global average of 6.5.

It submitted its first climate pledge under the Paris Agreement – known as its “nationally determined contribution” (NDC) – in 2016. In this, Pakistan said it would cut its emissions by up to 20% by 2030, when compared to its projections for business as usual. However, this level of emissions cuts was contingent on the country receiving $40bn in investment from developed countries by 2030.

Pakistan updated its climate pledge in 2021, to set a “cumulative conditional target” of limiting emissions to 50% of what it expects its business-as-usual levels to be in 2030. (Under a business-as-usual scenario, Pakistan expects its annual emissions to reach 1.6bn MtCO2e by 2030. If it meets its climate targets, its emissions will instead grow to 801 MtCO2e.) 

Pakistan says that 15% of its efforts to tackle emissions will be met by its own resources and 35% is subject to receiving $101bn in financial support from developed countries by 2030.

The country has not yet made a public pledge to reach net-zero emissions. On the sidelines of the COP26 climate summit, the climate aide of the former prime minister Imran Khan told the Third Pole that Pakistan “doesn’t believe in the net-zero concept at the moment”.
